    *Images not displayed correctly in Excel 2001 for Mac and non-Excel applications*
    
    Images inserted into worksheets via insert_image() may not display correctly in Excel 2011 for Mac and non-Excel applications such as OpenOffice and    LibreOffice.<br>
    Specifically the images may looked stretched or squashed.<br>
    This is not specifically an XlsxWriter issue. It also occurs with files created in Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.
